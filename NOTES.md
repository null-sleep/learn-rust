# Basics of Rust

Documenting things I want a quick reminder on with a focus on language fundamentals and core concepts one needs to konow when working in any language.

1. Project Setup
2. Functions
3. Modules
4. Structs
5. Classes / Traits
6. Enums
7. Error handling
8. Common libraries

Some spotlight on other relevant topics:

- pattern matching
- generics
- traits
- references
- the borrow checker
- Send/Sync
- Iterators

Since Rust is evolving rapidly, it is also useful to keep track of new and upcoming features which fundamentally change how Rust code should be written.
