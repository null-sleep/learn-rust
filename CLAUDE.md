- The goal of this project is to learn Rust by writing several small-medium programs.
- When providing feedback, please respond keeping in mind the following:
  - Point out anything that could be improved.
  - Provide any comments or insights which would be useful for someone new to Rust.
  - I am an experienced programmer and am trying to learn Rust.

- I may ask you to add notes. Please add them under `NOTES.md` trying to put them under the appropriate section or creating one. Feel free to use markdown formatting to make your notes more readable and move things around to better organize them.
